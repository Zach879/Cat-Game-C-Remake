# Cat-Game-C-Remake
C# Windows Form Application video game with open source and custom assets! Not C (the '#,' or hashtag symbol, isn't allowed in file names).

This is the remake and major improvement upon the Cat Game made in Visual Basic, released in late 2019 (early years 2/3), using Windows Form Applications on the .NET Framework (before .NET Framework and Core merged to "mimic" the JVM). This was the final project to complete before the end of the Berks Career and Technology Center cirriculum (except smaller sections that had to wait on other students to catch up). I had completed not one, but two video games to prolong my workload at BCTC. This has been extensively bug tested, but requires hard-coded file locations, so be cautious when trying to play the game yourself. Then, you can either run the project on Visual Studio, or simply copy and paste the .exe Application file to any file location. The .exe is located within Cat Game C Remake > Cat Game C Remake > Debug > bin. After the completion of this project, I began my pursuit to understand modern AI and implement it myself in real-world use-cases.
